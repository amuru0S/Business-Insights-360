# Business-Insights-360
This project is an integral part of the Code Basics "Data Analytics Bootcamp", and focuses on the insights of a hardware manufacturing company called "Atliq Hardware". 

# 🔍Overview 
Atliq Hardware is a rapidly growing company that operates across various countries and regions, offering diverse hardware products to many customers. Atliq encountered several challenges while analyzing data from multiple collective sources which involved Excel, SQL, and CSV files. During certain periods, Atliq faced huge losses due to these obstacles, so they decided to change their approach to making business decisions for sustainable growth in the enormously growing competitive world.

# 🎯Objective
The approach is to build an interactive and innovative report that provides valuable insights ranging from The Finance, Sales, Marketing, Supply Chain, and Executive views. The task involved developing insightful dashboards based on provided mock-ups to facilitate data-driven decision-making processes.

# 📋Project Execution: 
This project execution is fabricated through different levels:
🔸Integration of MySQL database with Power BI.
🔸Thorough data validation and transformation processes.
🔸Creation of calculated columns to enhance data analysis.
🔸Implementation of robust data modeling techniques.
🔸Design and construction of interactive dashboards.
🔸Iterative data validation and stakeholder feedback integration for continuous improvement.

# 📊Building the Dashboard: Addressing the stakeholder's requirements, the following dashboards have been built-
**Finance View**: I engineered a dynamic P&L table structure using DAX queries that enabled the creation of slicers for flexible data filtering.
𝑺𝒂𝒍e𝒔 𝑽𝒊𝒆𝒘: Decode customer and product performances influenced by Net Sales and Gross Margin Percentage.
𝑴𝒂𝒓𝒌𝒆𝒕𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝑽𝒊𝒆𝒘: Similar data as of Sales View but product-based instead of customers.

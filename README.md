# Business-Insights-360
This project is an integral part of the Code Basics "Data Analytics Bootcamp", and focuses on the insights of a hardware manufacturing company called "Atliq Hardware". 

# 🔍Overview 
Atliq Hardware is a rapidly growing hardware company that operates across various countries and regions, offering diverse hardware products to a wide range of customers. Atliq encountered several challenges while analyzing data from various collective sources which involved Excel, SQL, and CSV files. During certain periods, Atliq faced huge losses due to these obstacles, so they decided to change the approach of how they make business decisions for sustainable growth and to compete with the enormously growing world.

# 🎯Objective
The approach is to build an interactive and innovative report that provides valuable insights ranging from The Finance, Sales, Marketing, Supply Chain, and Executive views. The task involved developing insightful dashboards based on provided mock-ups to facilitate data-driven decision-making processes.

# 📋Project Execution: 
This project execution is fabricated through different levels:
🔸Integration of MySQL database with Power BI.
🔸Thorough data validation and transformation processes.
🔸Creation of calculated columns to enhance data analysis.
🔸Implementation of robust data modeling techniques.
🔸Design and construction of interactive dashboards.
🔸Iterative data validation and stakeholder feedback integration for continuous improvement.

# 📊Building the Dashboard: Addressing the stakeholder's requirements, the following dashboards have been built-
𝑭𝒊𝒏𝒂𝒏𝒄𝒆 𝑽𝒊𝒆𝒘: I engineered a dynamic P&L table structure using DAX queries that enabled the creation of slicers for flexible data filtering.
